# MatchingBrackets
Haskell project that checks if .cpp and .hpp files have matching brackets or not.
It can be quickly modified to accept other types of files, like .java, .c, .dart, etc.

<h1>Build and Run</h1>
To build and run the project you need to install an Haskell compilare (for example: GHC).
If you want to build the MathcingBrackets.hs file:
	1) open the terminal
	2) go to the directory of your file
	3) insert the following command:
	<code>$ ghc -o MatchingBrackets MatchingBrackets.hs</code>

Then, to run the program you need to type:
<code>$ ./MatchingBrackets</code>
